Description: 	A library which allows in-game recording and playback of minecraft players.
				While intended primarily as a library for use in other plugins it does
				provide Bukkit commands for those who just want to play around.
				
Notice:			This is a beta release.

Installation: 	Build the library and put the resulting plugin jar into plugins on your
				server. Or use a pre-built jar and put it in your plugins dir. The first
				time it is loaded it will create an Actor folder in your plugins dir where
				all your saved actors and scenes will be created.

				ActorPlugin.instance.record(player);
				
				* Stop recording a player
				ActorPlugin.instance.stopRecord(player);
				
				* Spawn a new actor using a given player's latest recording
				EntityActor newActor = ActorPlugin.instance.spawnActor(player, actorName);
				
				* etc... The full API is shown in the javadocs for ActorPlugin
